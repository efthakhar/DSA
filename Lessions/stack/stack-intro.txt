Stack:
=========
=> stack is a linear data structure
=> random access like array is not possible here. Only sequential access is possible
=> stack data structure follws a special rules which is : 
   both insertion and deletion is possible from only one end

   *** in stack last inserted element can take out first. 
       Therefore, stack follow the rule "LAST in FIRST out"/ LIFO

        যে লাস্টে প্রবেশ করে সে সবার আগে বের হবে। 
        আর যে সবার আগে প্রবেশ করে সে বের হয় সবার পরে।

=> Insertion in stack is called push 
=> Deletion in stack is called pop
=> Push and Pop can be performed from only one end which is known as "Top"

=> Operations in Stack Data structure:
   1. Push ( Add new element at top )
   2. Pop  ( Remove topmost element from stack )
   3. Peek/Top ( Return Top most element of stack )


=> Some use case of Stack data structure:
   1. Reversing String (ABCD)=>(DCBA)
   2. Undo mechanism 
   3. Recursion
   4. Varifying Balance of parenthesis
   5. Infix to Postfix Conversion
   6. Evolution of Postfix expression
