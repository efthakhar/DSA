Linked List:
===========
Linked list is a collection of data items where items are stored in 
non-consecutive/scattered locations of memory

** collection of nodes where each nodes stores a value and the address of next node
** Only sequentioal access is possible 
** every linked list has a head node which stores the address of first node
** last node store null value in address of next node in Singly linked list
** in worst case time complexity of accessing of any element is O(n) and 1 in case of best case
** insertiona and deletion of items is easy in linked list rather than Array

*** Binary search is not possible in linked list

Array:
===========
Array is a collection of data items where items are stored in
consecutive locations of memory
** random access is possible
** accessing elements in Array will take time complexity of O(1)
